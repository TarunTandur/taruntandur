<h2>üë®‚ÄçüíªProjects:</h2>

- <b>WEB CLOUD: Web based cloud storage for secure data sharing across platforms (Major Project)</b>
  - The web-based cloud storage project utilizing CP-AB-KEM algorithm and Java and MySQL server achieves high 
accuracy in secure data sharing. The CP-AB-KEM algorithm ensures that data is encrypted and decrypted 
correctly, while the Java and MySQL server provide a robust and reliable platform for data storage and 
retrieval.  
  - The project enables secure data sharing across platforms, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.. 
  - The project's scalability, reliability, and high security make it an ideal solution for organizations and 
individuals seeking secure cloud storage solutions

- <b>Geo Tracking of waste and triggering alerts and mapping areas with high waste index (Mini Project)</b>
  - The proposed system addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive geo-tracking solution. Raspberry 
Pi is used as the core processing unit, while GPS modules and sensors are integrated to track waste bin locations 
and fill levels. A web application provides real-time monitoring and updates, enabling citizens to track waste 
collection progress. 
  - The system offers improved efficiency, enhanced transparency, and better waste management, with potential for 
future expansion and integration with smart city infrastructure, adaptation to other waste types, and 
implementation of AI and ML algorithms. 
  - Implemented a geo-tracking system using Raspberry Pi and GPS to track waste bin locations and optimize 
collection routes, enabling real-time monitoring and efficient waste management.
